# React + Vite

###Get started:

`npm install`
`npm run dev`

###Technologies used:

Vite: This is a create-react-app alternative. Much faster load times.

JSON-Server: This is a great package that allows you to mock an API.

Concurrently: This allows me to run the vite server and json server at the same time.

Chakra-UI: Get component library with decent built-in styles.

React-Query: This is a great JS library that caches API responses. Because the state is cached per unique keys, it serves as a great alternative to redux for API responses.

Redux-Toolkit: A lightweight version of redux with less code bloat/overhead.
